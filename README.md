# Data-Analysis-Process
The project contains steps involved in the whole data analysis process and basics in data analysis.
The dataset, No-show appointments, seeks to explain why patients recieve doctor's appointment and fail to turn up. The dataset records whether or not a patient turned up for the appointment and relates the outcome to a number of characteristics that could explain why the patient turned up or not. There are a number of columns in the dataset which include:
PatientId- This is the unique patient's identification.

AppointmentID- This is the appointment number specific to the patient.

Gender-This tells the gender of the patient.

ScheduledDay- This shows the day in which the patient set up the appointment with the doctor.

AppointmentDay-This tells when and what time the appoitment is scheduled.

Age- This shows the age of the patient.

Neighbourhood-It shows the location of the hospital.

Scholarship-This indicates whther or not the patient is enrolled for the Brazilian scholarship.

Hipertension-This indicates whether or not the patient has hypertension.
Generally, we have similar percentage of males and females who did not show up for the doctor's appointment. This shows that gender may not be a factor that may determine whether or not a patient shows up for the doctor's appointment. We may further need to investigate more variables.

Among the people who showed up for the doctor's appointment, most of them had scholarships. Even though there were some who turned up and did not have a scholarship, they were fewer than those who showed up and had a scholarship.

From the data, age seemed to be an important factor as the younger ages of 18 and below showed up for the doctor's appointment, while those of older ages, 55 and above, barely showed up for the appointment.

Limitations

There is a very big gap between those who showed up for the doctor's appointment and those who did not. This may limit significant change or difference in comparing between certain variables. A smaller sample, which is not biased could be better.
